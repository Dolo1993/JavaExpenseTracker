# Overview

I created this software project to demonstrate my skills in the Java programming language. The software I 
developed is an "Expense Tracker," a console-based application that allows users to manage and track their expenses.
My primary goal was to deepen my understanding of Java, its syntax, and its capabilities by implementing a practical application.

 #Purpose
The purpose of creating this software was to achieve the following objectives as a software engineer:
Gain a hands-on experience in Java programming, covering topics like data structures, user input, and conditional statements.
Develop a functional and practical application to manage and track personal expenses.
Improve my problem-solving skills by designing and implementing a program with a user-friendly interface.
Learn about data structures like lists and maps, which are essential in Java development.
Understand the concepts of user input, data validation, and error handling in Java.
I also aimed to share my learning journey and insights with others, which is why I created a demonstration video to provide a walkthrough of the software's code and functionalities.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used the following tools and technologies:
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): I worked with a Java-specific IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, to write and debug the Java code efficiently.
Programming Language: I used the Java programming language to implement the software, taking advantage of its features and libraries for building console-based applications.
Libraries: In this project, I leveraged Java's standard libraries for tasks like user input handling, data storage, and collections (e.g., ArrayList and HashMap).

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to continue improving and expanding this project. Here are some areas I intend to focus on:	
- User Interface Enhancement: I will work on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- Statistics and Reports: Implementing features to generate expense reports, statistics, and visualizations to help users analyze their spending habits.
- Data Persistence: Adding functionality to save and load expense data from a file or database, enabling users to retain their data across sessions.
